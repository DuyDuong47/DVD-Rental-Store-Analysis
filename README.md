# DVD-Rental-Store-Analysis
I have recently finished working on my first portfolio project “DVD Rental Store Analysis” which is done using SQL for analyzing the dataset.

The project was broken down into small milestones, an approach similar to when working on real-life problems or projects.

## Introduction
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. In this project, the Sakila DVD Rental database was queried to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.
And here is the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided below

## Objective and Goals
In this project, I aim to answer 47 questions to collect information about customers and products.
